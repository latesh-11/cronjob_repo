Sure, I can help you with that. You can create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository. This file will define the actions to be taken, which in your case is to create a pull request from develop to stage once a week. Hereâ€™s a sample workflow file that you can modify according to your needs:

name: Weekly PR from develop to stage

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # This line means the action will trigger every Sunday at 00:00

jobs:
  createPR:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: develop

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: Update stage with develop
          branch: stage
          delete-branch: true
          title: Weekly update from develop
          body: |
